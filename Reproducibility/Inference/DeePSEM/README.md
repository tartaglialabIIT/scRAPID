A conda virtual environment to run DeePSEM on a GPU server can be installed using the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) that we provide.

We provide example input data in the [inputs](./inputs/) folder and a Bash script ([Ensemble_DeePSEM.sh](Ensemble_DeePSEM.sh)) to run DeePSEM in ensemble mode as suggested by the authors in [https://github.com/HantaoShu/DeepSEM](https://github.com/HantaoShu/DeepSEM).
