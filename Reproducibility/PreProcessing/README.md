We provide the Jupyter notebooks to pre-process and make the gene selection from the single-cell transcriptomic data for HepG2, K562, HEK293T, HCT116, C2C12 and mESCs datasets that we used in our study.

We provide for convenience:

* List of RBPs for which there are eCLIP experiments in the ENCODE project for HepG2 and K562 [eCLIP_RBPs.txt](eCLIP_RBPs.txt)
* List of human Transcription Factors used in BEELINE [human-tfs.csv](human-tfs.csv)
* RBPs from mouse and human obtained from the RBP2GO database [Table_HS_RBP.txt](Table_HS_RBP.txt) and [Table_MM_RBP.txt](Table_MM_RBP.txt)
* A folder with the processed data for the HepG2 and K562 datasets [processed_data.zip](processed_data.zip) and associated pseudotime values [PseudoTime](./PseudoTime/)
