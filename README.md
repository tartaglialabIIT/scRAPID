# scRAPID
single-cell transcriptomic-based RnA-Protein Interaction Detection

This repository includes data and codes associated with the manuscript [**Fiorentino et al, Predcition of protein-RNA interactions from single-cell transccriptomic data, bioRxiv, 2023**](addurl). 

* The folder [Reproducibility](/Reproducibility/) contains the codes needed to reproduce the results shown in the manuscript, including data pre-processing, Gene Regulatory Network inference, evaluation of protein-RNA interaction inference performance and plotting of the results.
* The folder [Tutorial](/Tutorial/) contains a guided tutorial to run the scRAPID pipeline on a new single-cell transcriptomic dataset.

Detailed explanations and instructions are provided in each folder.
